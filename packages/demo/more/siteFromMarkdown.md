The H1 paragraphs are the top-level areas of the site.
Everything before the first H1 is content for the Home page.

Many document formats can be converted to another (like Markdown), via [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

Links from one page to another can be constructed using anchor links. E.g., `See our [products](#Products)` creates a link to the top-level area page generated for the `# Products` H1 header.

# Products

The H2 paragraphs are sub-areas of the top-level areas.
Everything before the first H2 is content for the top-level area page (e.g., Products).

## For Business

The conversion tool is configurable with a navigation depth: if the navigation depth is 2, the H1 and H2 headings represent the navigation graph. Everything below H2 is content. Headings H3â€“H6 are used to indicate headings in the final content: if the navigation depth is 2, then an H3 in the full document becomes a real H1 header in the content of the browsable site.

### Why we're great for businesses

The above H3 heading would be promoted to an H1 heading on the "For Business" page.
