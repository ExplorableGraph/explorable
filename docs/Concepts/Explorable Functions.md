## Public vs private keys

Real-world metaphor: A restaurant offers you a menu of the meals it can serve — but the cook may be known to offer "off menu" choices. The menu is the set of public keys. If someone doesn't know anything about the restaurant, that's all they can order. The off-menu choices are the private keys. A customer who is in the know can order more things than appear on the menu.

Technological example: If you ask an operating system to show you the set of files in a folder, it will give you a list of files. Those are the folder's public keys: the things it tells you can ask for. But every folder also has some secret keys. If you ask a folder for an item called ".." (two periods), you'll get back the folder's parent folder. If you ask a folder for "." (one period), you'll get back the folder itself. The ".." and "." are examples of private keys the folder can offer up when asked, but which are normally hidden to keep things looking clean.
