The Explorable Graph project intends to offer strong-typed .d.ts declarations of all pieces of the core [explorable](../explorable) package. The project does not intend to use TypeScript directly, preferring to use native JavaScript files for the broadest possible audience.

_Call for help: I'm fairly proficient in writing TypeScript, but trying to represent the intensely abstract nature of the exfn construct in generics in a .d.ts file melts my brain. If you are a TypeScript type master and are interested in tackling that problem, please get in touch. â€“Jan_
